Coding exercise

On our site we often recommend restaurants from nearby cities if there are not enough high quality restaurants in the given city (see the `If you travel further` section of https://boam.com/ca/palo-alto/best-bbq-restaurants/ ).

As we extend our database to the complete US we need to find nearby cities for all cities. One of our colleagues found a nice dataset containing all US cities with their lat+long (https://simplemaps.com/data/us-cities, Basic dataset, free to download).

Your task is to find some nearby cities for each city in this dataset.
